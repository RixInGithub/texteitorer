anyways features bragging tiem!

* sometimes itll let u change font size
8 cool icon
* cool name
* save functionality
* opening ztuff (prob todo for now lol)
* helm tropics!!
* idek lol

anyways made in the letter c guys.

and how to build you may ask? after all, ur STUPID BUILD SCRIPT IS ERRORING FOR ME SAYING LIBRARIES NOT FOUND GRRRRR!!!!!!

first you have to install html help workshop™ by microsoft® so that the libraries for helm tropics are present. then run build.bat, tho that may take a while lolz

now you have a locally built exe of text eitorer!

lmaosofts does not take any responsibility from side effects of editing text eitorer code and violation of licenses (idk tho maybe).
